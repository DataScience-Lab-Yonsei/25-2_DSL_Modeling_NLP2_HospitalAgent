## How to Run Code

This project contains two main components:

* `gan/`: GAN-based denoising and image-to-image translation for PET image reconstruction
* `bbdm/`: **Slice-Consistent Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model for PET image reconstruction**

To run the code, please refer to the respective `README.md` files:

```bash
cd gan/
# or
cd bbdm/
```
